## Bookstore 

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I made a project that simulates a CRUD system for a bookstore.

In the process, I implemented all the things that i learned from the development course I took and also had to learn a lot of new technologies (like JavaScript).

### For this i used:

-Backend: Java, MySQL
<br>
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery
<br>
-API: Wordnik's Word of the day
<br>
-Frameworks: Spring, Bootstrap
<br>

---

At this point, the web is functional, responsive and highly interactive, but i have many features in mind to learn and incorporate:

:email: -Email sender <br>
:camera: -Image loading and processing <br>
:lock: -JWT <br>
:hearts: -Login with social networks <br>

Soon i will upload a demonstration video and put the project on a hosting service!
